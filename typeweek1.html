                        <p class="has-animation" data-delay="40">This first week has been bitter sweet. On the sweet side, I feel that I have learned more in one week about typography than I have in the past couple of years, and I really mean that. Not only have I had the chance to learn so much about typography, through intensive studying, reading and exercises,I have learned to look at every element of design in a completely different way in terms of contrast, proportion and relation. This of course, is still week one and is something that I will have to build on and refine as I go on, but it really does make a big difference to learn from the best and look at things from a different perspective. On the flip side of this wonderful new revelation, looking back at some of my old web work that makes heavy use of typography makes me cringe and makes me wish that I had started a project like this sooner. This week was broken into the following sections:</p>

                            <p class="has-animation" data-delay="40">The Typography 101 course taught by The Futur has been the cornerstone of this module. I managed to work through the majority of the video series this week which has proved to be incredibly insightful at a both a theoretical and practical level. I find it very interesting to listen to a seasoned veteran speak in so much detail about typography and how certain key rules can completely change a design and once these rules are learned through practice, can then be broken. What I enjoy most about this course is that it is delivered from a practitioners point of view and you are put to work straight away through both follow along exercises and DIY homework assignments. </p>

                            <p class="has-animation" data-delay="40">Being a big reader, I expected to finish “Stop Stealing Sheep And Find Out How Type Works” within 2 weeks. I’m not sure why, but this book failed to really grab my interest like I thought it would. It seems a fantastic book and has great reviews, but for some reason, it felt like a chore to read and I found myself getting bored quite quickly. I think this may largely be down to the face that the above course requires active participation which kept me very engaged, where the book seemed like more of a passive activity in comparison. In contrast, although not on the agenda, I decided to read through “The Vignelli Cannon” by the great Massimo Vignelli as it is quite short and easy to read and found that to be fantastic! Even though it does not go into great detail, it is written in such a matter of fact way by a legend that I found it very informative and inspiring. I found myself reading and re-reading this, almost as a sort of inspiration in between the exercises mentioned below.</p>

                            <p class="has-animation" data-delay="40">I really loved this one! This was a really fun exercise where I would find a typographic poster from one of the greats, draw a grid over it and recreate the poster myself in Illustrator. I will continue this every week and for this week, the great in question was Josef Muller-Brockmann. The purpose of this is to observe, in detail, the design decisions made by this legend when laying out a poster. I used to fool myself into thinking, when viewing a great poster of piece of design that “that’s easy, I could do that”. I could not! It’s not until you put pen to paper, pixel to screen or whatever means that you are using, do you see what kind of effort and vision that really goes into the work. I recommend this to everybody and have even uploaded recordings of myself doing this exercise.  </p>

As part of Typography 101, Chris gives a 7 week homework assignment adopted from Art Center and the Basel School of design which challenges the student to design a magazine cover given some specific constraints. This weeks constraints where to design 10 variations of magazine cover using 1 typeface, one point size and one weight. I thought that I would breeze through this but the experience was frustrating, humbling and ultimately, very rewarding. It forces you to stick to the basics and not apply any ‘tricks’. It is time quite consuming and requires a considerable amount of effort but from just a weeks experience, is probably the most important part of the module. It forces you to create something without tracing or watching some else do it. </p>
